In today's increasingly depleted earth resources and the continuous deterioration of the ecological environment, it has become urgent to obtain new energy sources.
Solar energy, as a natural resource, has shown its unique advantages with its abundant reserves and clean and pollution-free nature. However, solar power generation 
is affected by solar radiation, temperature, weather, and other factors, of which weather is the most uncontrollable factor. When the sky is cloudy or thick clouds,
solar power generation becomes unpredictable, which is an essential obstacle in using solar energy. At the same time, accurate solar forecasting allows for a 
more efficient energy mix between power plants and grid operators. However, in recent years, machine learning has played a significant role in solar radiation
prediction. This paper aims to use three machine learning techniques: long-term memory, Transfer Learning, and Random Forest to predict solar radiation (GHI). 
Data from Jersey City (USA) 2018 were analyzed. Three ML models were used for training and validation by combining features of past data, prediction, mean, and variance.
The experimental results showed that using a Random Forest model improved predicting solar radiation (GHI) accuracy.
